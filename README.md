Cleaver creates conforming tetrahedral meshes for multimaterial or multiphase volumetric data using the Lattice Cleaving algorithm described [here](https://cleaver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#method).

The software was initially developed by the NIH Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing at the University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute.
